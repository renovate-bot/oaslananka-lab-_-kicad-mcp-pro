# 2026 Technical Roadmap

This roadmap converts the May 2026 research findings into enforceable repository
work. It favors small gates and measurable artifacts over large rewrites.

## P0: Stabilize current CI and release loops

- Keep `corepack pnpm run check:ci` green on Linux and smoke coverage green on
  macOS/Windows.
- Keep `release:check` scoped to current release sections so historical changelog
  entries do not break normal CI.
- Ensure organization mirror CI publishes status back to personal PR commits.
- Require PR descriptions to include exact commands run and generated artifact
  paths for agent-authored changes.

## P1: KiCad 10 runtime validation

- Keep the Ubuntu KiCad 10 smoke workflow running against a real `kicad-cli`.
- Extend smoke artifacts to include version output, stdout, stderr and generated
  export files.
- Add optional nightly/manual KiCad 10.x compatibility jobs without making RC or
  nightly builds required for release.

## P2: API modernization and compatibility guardrails

- Enforce no new SWIG/`pcbnew` usage with `compat:check`.
- Keep CLI export paths for headless deterministic exports.
- Expand IPC diagnostics in `doctor --json` with socket/auth/retry fields.
- Add adapter boundaries before exposing new KiCad IPC features as MCP tools.

## P3: HTTP and studio bridge hardening

- Add regression tests for bearer auth, token rotation, CORS origin rejection and
  wildcard rejection.
- Add debounce/delta-sync behavior to the studio watcher before increasing the
  context payload size.
- Publish a minimal threat model for local HTTP bridge deployments.

## P4: Engineering metadata enrichment

- Add structured material/stackup resources for SI/PI/EMC tools.
- Move analysis defaults into explicit JSON resources with schemas.
- Keep generated recommendations traceable to physical inputs such as substrate,
  copper weight, trace width and current assumptions.

## Publishing surfaces

| Surface | Purpose | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| PyPI | Python package distribution | release workflow, metadata sync, package smoke |
| GitHub Releases | Source release, SBOM, provenance | release-please and attestation |
| GHCR | CI/runtime images | Docker build + Trivy |
| MCP registry | MCP discovery metadata | `metadata:check` |
| Documentation site | User and operator docs | `mkdocs build --strict` + link check |
| VS Code Marketplace | KiCad Studio integration | separate extension release gate |

## Non-goals

- Do not add a second release automation system beside release-please.
- Do not require KiCad GUI for normal `check:ci`.
- Do not merge mirror-only fixes that should live in the canonical repository.
